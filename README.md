# face-recognition-detection-in-wild

Trained a 2D-PCA Machine learning-based model for face recognition by writing 2D-PCA algorithm from scratch as feature extraction and KNN for
classification, which can recognize the 40 different people(total 400 images) with an accuracy of 98.75 %.

Implemented Viola & Jones face detection algorithm over the images for detecting faces in images.
